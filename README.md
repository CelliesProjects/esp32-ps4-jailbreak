# esp32-ps4-jailbreak
Minimal PS4 5.05 jailbreak on a ESP32.

This is a minimal implementation of the PS4 hack by qwertyoruiopz. It just contains the HEN for the PS4 on fw 5.05.

### How to use:

Flash the compiled software to your ESP32 and upload the included 'data' folder to the SPIFFS partition.

The ESP32 will start an accesspoint named 'ESP32 5.05 jailbreak server'. 

Connect to this AP with your PS4 and browse to 192.168.4.1 to enable HEN on your PS4.
